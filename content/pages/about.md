### What I do

I study physics at [St. Xavier's College](http://www.sxc.edu.np/) and do a bit of "research". I am also interested in programming.

### About this blog

I'll post about the things i'm interested in. This will serves as an archive for myself and hopefully at the same time be of use to people on the internet. I intend to post about maths, physics, programming and techs that I am interested in.
