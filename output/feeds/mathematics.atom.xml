This is just
supposed to be a very very quick rundown of mathematical preliminaries that
forms the basis of spacetime in the general theory of relativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lengths, area, volume, curvature, rate of change etc are some of the things that
we are interested to study in geometry. We have a good handle on those when the
underlying space is nice and flat Euclidean. We are interested to extend this
ability to spaces that are not Euclidean. As a physicist, we are interested to
model spacetime mathematically. And if we are Einstein, we might be looking to
allow it a curvature and hope it somehow encodes gravitation.  Differential
geometry is our attempt to model such physical reality in all mathematical
rigour without being too restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the coarsest level, spacetime is a set. It's a set of points. Let's call this
set &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt;. Does a set so defined have enough complexity to model spacetime? Of
course not. In fact, let's see what we have. A set is just an unordered
collection of elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a sheet of paper to be some kind of two dimensional spacetime. Now,
shred this sheet into pieces. That's not enough, collect all the pieces and
grind them into fine powder, finest you can imagine. Finally, give it a good
shuffle and that's what we have so far as a mathematical model of this paper
sheet spacetime. We can see that the immediate next thing we want to have is
some notion of locality or neighborhood meaning we want to be able to capture
the idea that some points are "close" to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/paper2powder.png" class='center'/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we introduce a new set and give it a fancy name &lt;strong&gt;topology&lt;/strong&gt;. A topology on
a set is just a set which contains a whole bunch of sets as its elements, each
of which defines a "locality". So, for each point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p \in M\)&lt;/span&gt;, there could be an
entry in this set, denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal O\)&lt;/span&gt;, which contains all the neighbour
points of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/topology.png" class='center'/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us a way to put the powder together and give it a structure in some
sense. But there are a lot of ways we could do it. In fact, it turns out the
kind of topology that one can form given the restrictions we have so far are so
many that most of them resemble the spacetime as we know it too little, whatever
that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at a special kind of them called topological manifolds.  &lt;strong&gt;Topological
manifolds&lt;/strong&gt; are topological space that can be charted similar to how surface of
earth can be charted to a map on a plane sheet of paper. So, we require a
condition that our model of spacetime be mapped &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; to subset of
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb R^n\)&lt;/span&gt;. This essentially requires that there exist neighborhood to every
point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p \in M\)&lt;/span&gt; and for every neighborhood that its image can have in the chart.
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="images/chartmap.png" class='center' width="400"/&gt;
&lt;figcaption class='center'&gt;fig. Chart map from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal U\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{x(U)}\)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we now add one more information to our collection namely an &lt;strong&gt;Atlas&lt;/strong&gt;
denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal A\)&lt;/span&gt; which is a collection of charts &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\mathcal U, \mathcal
x)\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal U \subseteq M\)&lt;/span&gt; is a portion of the manifold that is covered
in this particular chart and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is the map that takes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal U\)&lt;/span&gt; to a portion
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{x(U)} \subseteq \mathbb R^n\)&lt;/span&gt;. We have a whole bunch of charts in the
atlas because a single might not cover the entire manifold. So, we now consider
only those spaces that are locally Euclidean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper spacetime as a topological manifold, is closer to what we want compared
to the powder that we had earlier.  But you can still take the paper, crumple it
with your hand and give it wrinkles and creases. You can even stretch, twist and
turn and do all sorts of crazy thing with it.  You could stretch it along one
side and make a wire out of it. It doesn't care. It's still the same in our
model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say, stretching and squeezing is a property that we want to have in
our model, afterall that's what we want to model gravitation with and you're
right. We dont get rid of this flexibility. But we should be able to distinguish
between two configurations. We want a notion of curvature. From Euclidean
geometry, we know that curvature can be defined by employing second derivatives.
We don't know how to do differentiation in a manifold yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to do calculus in charts, where we have all nice results and
theorems from analysis. But, immediately a question arises: will the results we
get in charts will be well-defined? Because, one could just as easily go and
look at another chart. The condition that holds in a chart that lead us to
ascribe certain property on our manifold may not hold in another chart. This is
very serious. We don't want the velocity of a particle, curvature of a
trajectory and so on to depend on the choice of our coordinates (which is what
charts really are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's think this through. Let's say we want to establish whether a certain
curve on a manifold (this could be a particle trajectory) is continuous. We can
go to a chart &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\mathcal U, \mathcal x)\)&lt;/span&gt; and check for the continuity of the
chart representative of the curve. But the problem is when we have another chart
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\mathcal V, \mathcal y)\)&lt;/span&gt; and the two charts have some overlap. Now, in this
overlap, the chart representatives of the curve better agree on their
continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/chart transitions.png" height="200" class='center'/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are 3 maps of interest here namely &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\circ y^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;. We
know from analysis, that a continuous curve in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb R^n\)&lt;/span&gt; to remain
continuous after a map, it suffices that the map be continuous. Therefore, we
know that we need &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\circ y^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; to be continuous. But, we also know that
composition of two continuous functions is continuous. So, the continuity of
chart maps and their inverses come to rescue and our definition of continuity
that involves going to a chart remains well defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was lucky. But what about differentiability? Can we define
differentiability of curves and functions in the same way - by going to charts?
Well, you cant make the same arguments about differentiability(chart maps are
merely continuous and continuous maps may not be differentiable). So, the answer
is no. We can't define differentiability without some further restrictions on
our atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And believe it or not, what we do is restrict our atlas such that chart
transition map between any pair of overlapping charts is infinitely
differentiable or in other word smooth. With that restriction, we now have a
smooth manifold &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((M, \mathcal{O, A})\)&lt;/span&gt; where we can do calculus without running
into ill definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to it, of course. For example, we haven't defined a metric yet.
So, we can't talk about lengths and angles like we always had on flat Euclidean
space. It's not clear how one could define derivatives and so
on without a notion of length. We'll stumble upon a major hurdle in defining
derivatives of tensor fields. I will talk about these in upcoming posts if I
get the clarity and a way to avoid too much maths.&lt;/p&gt;
