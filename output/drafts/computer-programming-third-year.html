<h2>Ch - 1: Introduction to computer systems</h2>
<p><strong> Q. What is a computer ? </strong></p>
<p>Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and processes
these using a set of instructions (called program) to produce the result (called output) and also
saves the output for future use. It can process both numerical and non-numerical (arithmetic and logical)
calculations. The term computer is derived from the Latin term <em>computare</em>, which means to calculate.</p>
<p><strong> Q. Write about computer architecture. </strong></p>
<p>Computer Architecture is all about the structure and behaviour of the computer as seen by the
user. A computer has various components. The study of how these components fit and work together to
perform the desired computation is known as computer architecture.</p>
<p>The main components in a typical computer system are the processor, memory, input/output devices,
and the communication channels that connect them.</p>
<p><img alt="computer architecture diagram" src="/images/architecture.webp"></p>
<p><strong>Processor</strong></p>
<p>The processor is the workhorse of the system. It is the component that executes a program by performing
arithmetic and logical operations on data. It is the only component that creates new information by
combining or modifying current information. In a typical system there will be only one processor, known
at the central processing unit, or CPU. Modern high performance systems, often have more than one
processor aka parallel processors or vector processors. Systems with only one processor are serial
processors or also known as scalar processors.</p>
<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>
<p>Memory is a passive component that simply stores information until it is requested by another part of
the system. During normal operations it feeds instructions and data to the processor, and at other
times it is the source or destination of data transferred by I/O devices. Information in a memory is
accessed by its address. Memory can be thought of as a one-dimensional array M. A processor's request to
the memory might be:  </p>
<p><em>send the instruction at location M[1000]</em> <br>
<em>store the following block of data in locations M[0] to M[255]</em>  </p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p><strong>I/O Devices</strong></p>
<p>Input/output (I/O) devices transfer information without altering it to and from the user space and one
or more internal components. These are also called Man machine interfaces. I/O devices can be secondary
memories, for example <strong>disks</strong> and <strong>tapes</strong>,
or devices used to communicate directly with users, such as <strong>displays</strong>, <strong>keyboards</strong>, <strong>joystick</strong>,
and <strong>mouse</strong>, etc.  </p>
<p><strong>Link components</strong></p>
<p>The components that link the system together could be simple links that connect two devices or more
complex switches that interconnect several components and allow any two of them to communicate at a
given point in time. When a switch is configured to allow two devices to exchange information, all other
devices that rely on the switch are blocked, i.e. they must wait until the switch can be reconfigured.  </p>
<p><a name="cpu"></a></p>
<h4>Central Processing Unit</h4>
<p><em><strong>Q. What is the use of CPU in a computer system? How does it work?</strong></em></p>
<p>CPU is short for central processing unit. It is sometimes referred to as the central processor, but more
commonly as processor. The CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. In
terms of computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system.</p>
<p>Major functions of CPU are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform all basic arithmetic operations</li>
<li>Perform logical operations i.e. decision making tasks</li>
<li>Facilitate reading and writing to and from memory devices</li>
<li>Connect all the input/output devices together and interpret signals</li>
</ol>
<p>CPU has two distinct components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU)</strong><br>
  ALU is a digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. It is the
  fundamental building block of CPU. Transistors are combined together to make basic arithmetic
  units like adder, substractor, etc and also logic gates such as <em>AND</em>, <em>OR</em>, <em>NOT</em>, <em>XOR</em>, etc.
  These work together to perform all arithmetic, floating point and bitwise operations. Logic gates
  helps in decision making and switch case operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Unit (CU)</strong><br>
  A control unit is also made up of transistor circuits.
  A CU component is considered the processor brain because it issues orders to just about
  everything and ensures correct instruction execution. Some of it works are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>handles all processor control/interrupt signals.</li>
<li>directs all input and output flow</li>
<li>fetches code for sequential instructions from programs into memory</li>
<li>directs other units by providing control and timing signals.</li>
<li>handles multi taksing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Memory Systems</h3>
<p>Memory system consists of memory devices, means to access, read and write data and link components
to the cpu. The main purpose of memory system is to store and access data. Depending on the type of
the data, they are split into two types which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary Memory</li>
<li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="primary-memory"></a></p>
<h5>Primary Memory</h5>
<p>Primary Memory or main memory is the area in a computer which stores data and information for fast
access. It’s a
memory which is used to store frequently used programs which can be directly accessed by the processing
unit for further processing. This is where the currently executing set of instructions resides.  </p>
<p>It is also called  <em>volatile memory</em> because the data is stored temporarily and is liable to change or
loss in case of power failure or shutdown. So, the data is only intact as long as the computer is
running. Because of their need for fast access time, they are made up of semiconductor chips.</p>
<p>Every program is loaded into main memory before execution.</p>
<p>Primary memory are of two types:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong> Random Access Memory is what is what we mean when we say main memory. It is a memory to load
  the program before execution. They are still divided as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Static RAM (SRAM)</strong>: They are more expensive, consume less power and have higher speed
  (20-40 ns) than DRAM. These are used in cache or as main memory in high end computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</strong>: They are cheaper, have moderate speed (60-100 ns) and need more power. They
  are used in main memory. This is comparitively denser memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ROM:</strong> Read only memory can only be read as the name suggests. They are written at the time of
  manufacture by the manufacturer themselves. ROM is non-volatile memory. These generally host very
  essential program(BIOS) that is loaded at the boot time and is required to load the operating system.
  These also have some types which are:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROM</strong> (Programmable ROM): can only be written once.  </li>
<li><strong>EROM</strong> (Erasable ROM): can be rewritten by erasing previous data. needs exposure to UV light for
  erasing</li>
<li><strong>EEROM</strong> (Electrically Erasable ROM): similar to EROM but erasing can be done electrically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="secondary-memory"></a></p>
<h5>Secondary Memory</h5>
<p>Secondary memory on the other hand is the external memory of the computer which can be used to store data
and information on a long-term basis. It’s a non-volatile memory which means data stays intact even if
the computer is turned off. Data cannot be directly processed by the processing unit in secondary memory;
in fact, it is first transferred into the main memory before processing.</p>
<p>Secondary memory consists of all external storage devices that are capable of storing high volumes of data
such as hard drives, floppy disks, magnetic tapes, USB flash drives, CDs, DVDs, etc. It’s generally slower
than primary memory but can store much larger amount of data in the range of gigabytes to terabytes.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.differencebetween.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Primary-Memory-VERSUS-Secondary-Memory-.jpg">Here</a>
is a table that shows the difference between secondary and main memory.</p>
<p><a name="input-devices"></a></p>
<h4>Input Devices</h4>
<p>Devices used to feed any input signal into the computer are called input devices.
Following are some of the important input devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>Joy Stick</li>
<li>Light pen</li>
<li>Track Ball</li>
<li>Scanner</li>
<li>Graphic Tablet</li>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>Magnetic Ink Card Reader(MICR)</li>
<li>Optical Character Reader(OCR)</li>
<li>Bar Code Reader</li>
<li>Optical Mark Reader(OMR)</li>
</ul>
<p>This <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/computer_input_devices.htm">page</a> has the
description for each devices.</p>
<p><a name="output-devices"></a></p>
<h3>Output Devices</h3>
<p>These are the devices where the output of the program or data stored in the memory devices can be
seen by the user.</p>
<p>Following are some of the important output devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors</li>
<li>Graphic Plotter</li>
<li>Printer</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="computer-software"></a></p>
<h3>Computer Software</h3>
<p>Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a specific and well-defined task. A program 
is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.</p>
<p>There are two types of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>System Software</strong><br>
  System software is software designed to provide a platform for other software. It is an interface
  between application softwares and the hardware. Operating system is an example of system software.
  Some others are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BIOS</strong>: (basic input/output system) gets the computer system started after you turn it on and
manages the data flow between the operating system and attached devices such as the hard disk, video
adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.</li>
<li><strong>Boot</strong>: Boot program loads the operating system into the computer's main memory or random access
memory (RAM).</li>
<li><strong>Assembler</strong>: It takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of binary
digits that the processor understands.</li>
<li><strong>Device Driver</strong>: A device driver controls a particular type of device that is attached to your
computer, such as a keyboard or a mouse. The driver program converts the more general input/output
instructions of the operating system to messages that the device can understand. Eg. Keyboard
driver, display driver, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Software</strong><br>
Application software are the program that are of specific utility to the users. Application software
can be a single program like MS Notepad with a single utility function. It can also be a collection
of programs called software package which perform more broad and related tasks. For ex. MS Office
Suite which includes MS Word, MS Powerpoint, MS Excel, and so on.<br>
The characteristics(differences) of application software compared to System software are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close to the user</li>
<li>Easy to design</li>
<li>More interactive</li>
<li>Slow in speed</li>
<li>Generally written in high-level language</li>
<li>Easy to understand</li>
<li>Easy to manipulate and use</li>
<li>Bigger in size and requires large storage space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="operating-systems"></a></p>
<h3>Operating Systems (OS)</h3>
<p>Operating system is a system software which provides platform for other user applications to run on
a computer. Operating system maintains an ecosystem of input and output devices working with each
other in harmony.  </p>
<p>Besides I/O devices, OS also manages otehr hardware resources such as network
devices which includes modem, routers etc.</p>
<p>An operating system has three distinct components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel</strong><br>
  This is a software that provides basic level control over all the hardware devices. Its main roles
  include reading/writing data to and from memory, dealing with data received from input devices like
  keyboard, mouse and data to be sent to output devices like monitor and also dealing with incoming
  and outgoing data via networks.  </li>
<li><strong>User Interface</strong><br>
  This is the part of the OS which facilitates the user to interact with the computer. So, this
  includes, graphical window, icons, desktop, command line etc.  </li>
<li><strong>Application Programming Interface(API)</strong><br>
  Presence of API in the OS allows the programmers to write application softwares more easily. API
  provides an interface for the programmer to manipulate the underlying hardware using high level
  languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of operating systems are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Linux, etc.</p>
<p><a name="generations-of-computer"></a></p>
<h3>Generations of Computer</h3>
<p>Generations of computer indicate a major shift in the technology involved in computing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>First Generation Computers</strong><br>
First generation computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. They were large 
enough to take up entire room. They consumed a lot of power and generated significant amount of heat which
had to be regulated using cooling system so as to prevent damage to the system due to overheating. This made 
them expensive to operate. They were instructed with machine code had very limited computing power.
The UNIVAC, EDVAC, and ENIAC computers are the examples of first gen. computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second Generation Computers (1956-63)</strong><br>
Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors in second generation computers. Transistors are semiconductor based
switches. They significantly reduced space and power consumption compared to first gen computers. Transistors
are also more reliable than vacuum tubes and hence less prone to failure. Heat regulation was much less of a 
concern.
They used punched cards for input and printouts for output. Assembly language was used in these computers which
avoided the need to work with binary machine code.
IBM 1620, IBM 7090, PDP-1 are few examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third Generation Computers (1964-71)</strong><br>
These computers used integrated circuit(IC) which is essentially a complex electronic circuit made up of a lot
of miniaturized transistors, diodes, resistors etc. This reduced the size of the computer even further and
significantly increased speed and efficiency.
Keyboard, monitors and Operating system interfaces were introduced in these computers. These were the first computer
capable to run multiple applications at once.
Programming languages like COBOL, FORTRAN were commonly used.
IBM 370, PDP-11, CDC 7600 etc are the examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fourth Generation Computers (1971-Present)</strong><br>
Thousands of integrated circuits are built onto a single piece of silicon to form a microprocessor. This brought
down the size and cost of the computers. High speed networking of computers were developed that linked multiple 
computers together. User friendly Operating systems and applications were developed as computers slowly became common 
household items. 
Semiconductor based memory devices were also introduced which are faster, smaller in size aster and
have low failure rate. 
Many high level programming languages were introduced and used extensively during this period.
Apple Macintosh, Pentium computers etc the examples.</p>

<h2>Ch - 2: Introduction to Programming Languages</h2>
<p><a name="programming-language"></a></p>
<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>Programming language is any language used to instruct a computer for performing specific tasks. It
is a set of vocabulary and rules of grammar (syntax) like any other languages. Programming languages
are low level and high level depending on how close to the hardware they deal with.</p>
<p><a name="evolution-of-programming-languages"></a></p>
<h3>Evolution of Programming Languages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Language</strong><br>
It's the code that a computer actually understands. It is written in binary representation. 
It's very difficult to code with machine language. Machine language is specific to the architecture of the
processor. These are considered very close to the machine. Early computers were programmed solely using
machine code.</li>
<li><strong>Low Level Language</strong><br>
Low level language are still close to the machine but they are written with characters instead of binary
which make them more approachable. They provide very little or no abstraction of programming concepts. Assembly
code is an example of low level language.</li>
<li><strong>High Level Language</strong><br>
These are programming languages with more rich programming abstraction, syntax, and structural constructs. It
is much easier to work with high level languages. They save time of the programmer and increase productivity.
Vast majority of the code written today are written in high level language. Depending on the level of abstraction, 
some high level language can be considered low or close to the machine than others. For example C is considered
closer to machine than python, ruby, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Q. What is Structured Programming? </strong><br>
It is a programming paradigm in which structured control flow constructs like choice(if, else,
then), repetition(for, while), block structures (with curly braces), functions etc are used to
improve the clarity, quality, and development time of the programs.</p>
<p><a name="compilation-process"></a></p>
<h3>Compilation Process</h3>
<p><strong> Q. Describe the compilation process. </strong><br>
Compilation is the process of translating the source code written by the programmer into a language
that is understood by the target machine.  </p>
<p>Compilation is a multi step process. It has four distinct process which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong> Preprocessing</strong><br>
This is the first step of the compilation. In this step, lines starting with a # character are
interpreted by the preprocessor as preprocessor commands. Any macros or constant definitions made in
those lines are used to substitute the occurance of the macros or constants in the rest of the
source code.<br>
The library files that are included in the header are also attached with the program in this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compilation</strong><br>
The second step is called the compilation. In this step, the preprocessed code is translated to assembly instructions specific to the target processor architecture. This is still human readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assembly</strong><br>
During this stage, an assembler is used to translate the assembly instructions to object code. The
output is written in an object file with <code>.o</code> extension and contains the actual instructions that
the target processor can run.<br>
Since large program generally contain multiple source code file, more than one object files are
generated in this step. They have to linked together to form the final program which is done in the
next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking</strong><br>
In the last step, the object files are linked together using a piece of software called linker to create
a complete set of instructions that can be executed in the machine. An executable file is produced after
this step which has the extension <code>.exe</code> in windows system. This file can now be run to perform the
desired task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preprocessor, compiler, assembler, linker all are the part of C compiler. They don't need to be run
seperately.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is Object code?</strong><br>
Object code is a set of instruction codes that is understood by a computer at the lowest hardware level. Object code is produced by a compiler that reads some higher level computer language (like C) source code and translates them into equivalent machine language instructions. Object code is produced by assembler and they have <code>.o</code> extension.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you mean by source code?</strong><br>
It is the sequence of instructions written by the programmer. Source code is in plain
text.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Define Executable code.</strong><br>
It's a piece of code that can be executed on the target machine. Executable code is produced in the
last step of compilation process after linking all the object files together to form a complete set
of instructions called program.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What's Interpreter?</strong><br>
Unlike C, some programming languages can directly be executed from the source code without
going through the compilation process. The software that takes in the source code and directly executes
them is known as interpreter. Interpreters avoid the neccesity to have a previously compiled executable
program. Python interpreter is an example.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is a Loader? What does it do ?</strong><br>
A loader is a part of the Operating System that is responsible for loading the programs into memory
and preparing the execution of the program. Once the loader loads the program into memory, the OS
passes control to the loaded program code for its execution.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you understand by Algorithm?</strong><br>
An algorithm is a detailed series of instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem.
For example, Euclid algorithm is an algorithm to find the greatest common devider of two numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What do you mean by Flow Chart?</strong><br>
A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. Before writing the
source code, it is helpful to draw a flow chart containing the algorithm that you intend to
implement. Flow chart makes coding a little more easy especially when the program is large and
complicated. It also helps in debugging.</p>
<p>Here's a quick illustration for various elements used in a Flow chart</p>
<p><img alt="Flow chart symbols" src="https://d3n817fwly711g.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/All-you-Need-to-Know-about-Flowcharting.png"></p>
<p>You'll mostly only need Data (i.e. input/output), process, decision, and start/end.</p>

<h2>Ch - 3: Fundamentals of C Programming</h2>
<p>Some terms that could be asked for definition:
<a name="keywords"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Keywords are those words whose meaning is already defined by Compiler and cant be
  used as an identifier by the user. Eg. while, main, do, for, if, else, typedef, struct, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="identifier"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier:</strong> An identifier is a name that is assigned by the user to a program element such
  as variable, type, class, function, etc.<br>
  Rules for Identifier:  <ol>
<li>The first character must be an alphabet or an underscore and can be followed only by any number alphabets, or digits or underscores.</li>
<li>They must not begin with a digit.</li>
<li>Identifiers should not be of length more than 31 characters.</li>
<li>Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. That is, identifiers are case sensitive.</li>
<li>Commas or blank spaces are not allowed within an identifier.</li>
<li>Keywords cannot be used as an identifier.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="variables"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables</strong>: Variable is a name given to a location in a memory where a program can manipulate the data.
A variable could be of any type like int, float, char, etc.<ul>
<li>Types of variables:<ul>
<li><strong>Static and Dynamic</strong>: This is a classification based on when the memory for the variable is allocated.
Static variables are those variables whose memory space is allocated by the compiler at the compile time. On the
other hand, dynamic variables are allocated memory space in the run-time by the program itself. See <a href="#dma">Dynamic memory allocation</a></li>
<li><strong>Local and Global</strong>: This classification is based on the <strong>scope</strong> of a variable. If a variable is available 
only within a function or a block in which it is defined, then such variable is said to be <strong>local</strong>  to that 
function or block. But if the variable is available to the entire program, then it's called a <strong>global</strong> variable. </li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span><span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(){</span>

<span class="cm">        declared outside. Former is said to be</span>
<span class="cm">        local within this block</span>
<span class="cm">        */</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Inner a = %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">Inner b = %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Outer a = %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">Outer b = %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Everything within a pair of braces <code>{</code> <code>}</code> makes a block. Variables declared within the block are limited in scope to the block itself.
Therefore, the expected output of the above program is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Inner</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>
<span class="n">Inner</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="n">Outer</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span>
<span class="n">Outer</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the variable <code>b</code> created outside does <em>pass</em> inside the braces-block but not the other way around. 
This is also called <strong>Lexical scoping</strong> is programming languages.</p>
<p><a name="comments"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Comments in programming, as the name suggests, are programmer-readable texts that are written
in the source code to explain or comment on a portion of the code, statement, a function or an expression to help the
reader understand the code fast and more easily.<br>
Comments serve various purpose which are outlined below:  <ul>
<li>To explain a piece of code.</li>
<li>To write pseudo-code which will later be filled in with actual code.</li>
<li>To explain why a certain algorithm was chosen instead of the other.</li>
<li>Comments can be used to communicate when the project is large and multiple programmers are
working on the same project at once.</li>
<li>Comments can be used to generate documentation for an API or a program automatically.</li>
<li>During debugging, any portion of the code can be commented for trail and error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In C, any text between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> are considered as comments. 
For eg:  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">gcd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm">    Greatest common divider function.</span>
<span class="cm">    Takes two integers n and m as input.</span>
<span class="cm">    Returns a single integer.</span>
<span class="cm">    */</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a name="constant"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant</strong>: Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called <strong>literal constants</strong>. And the name given to them are called <strong>symbolic constants</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">#</span><span class="n">DEFINE</span> <span class="n">PI</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1415</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In above, <code>PI</code> is a symbolic constant, and <code>3.1415</code> is a literal constant.</p>
<p><a name="expression"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expression</strong>: an expression is any legal combination of symbols that represents a value. For
  example: <code>x+5</code>, <code>"Programming"</code>, <code>4.023</code>, etc. Expression can have operators in them so long as
  they are valid as + operator in previous example.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
<a name="statement"></a>
* **Statement** : Statement is any combination of keywords, identifiers, and symbols that gives a meaningful
action to be done by the machine. Statements are of three types:
    * Expression statement: It's a simple statement 
-->

<p><a name="ch4"></a></p>
<h2>Ch - 4, 10: Input and Output &amp; File Handling</h2>
<p><a name="stdin"></a>
Input can mainly be from two sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a <a href="#files">file</a></li>
<li>And from the keyboard<br>
<code>getchar()</code> reads from the keyboard one character at a time.  </li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getchar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;\n&#39;</span><span class="p">){</span>
      <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%c&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There's also <code>getche()</code> which echoes back the character entered onto the display unlike <code>getchar()</code>.</p>
<p>There's <code>scanf()</code> that allows you to take formatted input from keyboard.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">day</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Enter your DOB (dd/mm/yyyy): &quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">scanf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%d/%d/%d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">day</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">month</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">year</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="cm">/* reads input in that specified format</span>
<span class="cm">  of dd/mm/yy */</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And output can be into two targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>To a <a href="#files">file</a></li>
<li>To the monitor</li>
</ul>
<p><code>putchar()</code> display one character at a time onto the display. <code>printf()</code> is for formatted display.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">txt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;This is a text&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="cm">/* print in specified format */</span>
   <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%s&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">txt</span><span class="p">);</span>

   <span class="cm">/* putchar outputs one character at a time */</span>
   <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
       <span class="n">putchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">txt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To input/output strings at once:</p>
<p><code>gets()</code> reads string from the keyboard. <code>puts()</code> prints string onto the display.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">str</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">];</span>

   <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;Enter a value :&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">gets</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">str</span> <span class="p">);</span>

   <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">You entered: &quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">puts</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">str</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a name="files"></a></p>
<h4>Files</h4>
<p>To work with a file, you have to create a file handle for it. File handle is nothing but a pointer
to a FILE type. You create it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;File.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Above line creates a pointer named fpt to a FILE type variable in memory that is returned by <code>fopen()</code>
function. It creates a handle for the file "File.txt" which is opened in readonly 'r' mode.</p>
<p>Now to read from the file there's <code>fgetc()</code>. It reads one character at a time as the name suggests. 
<code>getc()</code> is equivalent to <code>fgetc()</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fgetc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">EOF</span><span class="p">){</span>
        <span class="n">putchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>EOF</code> above indicates End Of File. So, the loop runs till it reaches the end of the file.</p>
<p>You can read string at once ie. array of character at once with <code>fgets()</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="n">fgets</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Above reads, 99 characters from the file pointer fpt and copies it into the variable text. The last
element in a character array should always be <code>\0</code> which indicates the end of the string.</p>
<p>There are <code>fputc()</code> and <code>fputs()</code> to write character and string into the file.</p>
<p>But for that the file should be opened in write mode. </p>
<p>To do that, first lets <strong>close</strong> the file opened above and reopen it in write mode.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="cm">/* Now open in write mode */</span>
    <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;File.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, Let's read input from the keyboard with <code>getchar()</code> and write it onto the file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getchar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;\n&#39;</span><span class="p">){</span>
      <span class="n">fputc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>putc()</code> is equivalent to <code>fputc()</code>.</p>
<p>Remember the order of arguments. Character is the first and file pointer (buffer) is the second argument.</p>
<p><a name="getwputw"></a></p>
<h4>Read/Write Integers</h4>
<p>There are <code>getw()</code> and <code>putw()</code> functions to read and write integer values to/from a file. An example is given below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">j</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;file.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">putw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">putw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">putw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>

   <span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;file.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

   <span class="k">while</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">getw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="n">EOF</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="n">num</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">getw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
   <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The output is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">    1</span>
<span class="go">    2</span>
<span class="go">    3</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a name="fprintf"></a></p>
<h4>Formatted read/write</h4>
<p>You know how <code>scanf()</code> and <code>printf()</code> read and print formatted texts from keyboard and to the display.</p>
<p>There are <code>fprintf()</code> and <code>fscanf()</code> that do essentially the same thing but with files.
Here's an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;File.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;w+&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="n">fptrintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;My fav. number is %d.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">);</span>

   <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That writes <code>My fav. number is 7.</code> to the file <code>File.txt</code>.</p>
<p>And similarly for <code>fscanf()</code>.</p>

<h4>Read/Write in Block</h4>
<p>We've seen how to read/write string and characters. We might want to write more complicated, custom
defined data type - for ex. a struct with 3 integers for day, month and year that constitute DOB.</p>
<p>In such cases, it is better to read/write in block. We can read/write in binary data of any size we
want instead of individual data type.</p>
<p>Let's create a struct and define a new type for date of birth to illustrate:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">DOB</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">day</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>

    <span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">DOB</span> <span class="n">dob</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>stuct DOB is now defined as dob data type.</p>
<p>Now, let's create a variable of type dob. We want to write it to a file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">dob</span> <span class="n">myBDay</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">day</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">month</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1987</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, we'll write it to the file at once.</p>
<p>But before we do, there's one important thing. We opened the file in write mode which is only good
for writing strings and characters.  </p>
<p>If we want to write in binary format, we have to open it in binary write mode i.e. "wb" instead of "w". Let's do that now.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fpt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;File.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;wb&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now we can write myBday into the file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">fwrite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">myBday</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fpt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Above line tells <code>fwrite()</code> to treat <code>12</code> bytes (= 3 integers) of data as one block and write <code>1</code> such
block reading from <code>&amp;myBday</code> location in memory into the file stream <code>fpt</code>.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that when you open in write mode everything that was in the file
previously gets erased and new data is written. </p>
<p>If you don't want to erase everything, you need open it in append mode with "a" argument.</p>
<p>All the modes are shown in table below:</p>

<p>Add "b" to each one of the above to read/write/append in binary mode. For ex. "wb+", "ab+**, etc.</p>

<strong>Q. Write a program to read a character and display it using getc and putc</strong></p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>getc()</code> and <code>putc()</code> are normally used to read and write from a file. But the question wants us to read it and display it to the monitor.</p>
<p>There are files streams (FILE <em>) associated with keyboard input and monitor output. They are defined in <code>stdio.h</code> as <code>stdin</code> and `stdout</em>*.</p>
<p>So, we pass them as the file stream instead of a handler of an actual file.</p>

<p><a name="expressions"></a></p>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>Expression in programming languages is any legal combination of symbols that evaluates
to a value. For eg. <code>5 + 6 * (1 + 3)</code> is an expression and so is <code>4 * x</code> where x is a variable of valid type.</p>
<p><a name="type-conversion"></a></p>
<h3>Type Conversion</h3>
<p>Type casting or conversion is the process of converting a data from one type to another.
This is done in two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implicit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Compiler automatically converts data types whenever it makes sense. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p">...</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">40000</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%lf&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>+</code> can only operate on data of same type. But, it makes sense to add two numbers: int and double.
So, compiler itself converts value of x into a double before evaluating the expression.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We may want to explicitly change the type of the variable sometimes. For ex.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p">...</span>
  <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">12.0</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, z is implicitly converted to float first and the expression <code>z/x</code> is evaluated. But since the
variable <code>y</code> is an integer variable, we want to assign an integer to y. </p>
<p>In the last line, <code>(int)</code> explicitly tells
the compiler to convert the result of the expression to an integer before assigning to <code>y</code>. 
Digits after decimal are truncated and only the integer part is assigned i.e. It is always rounded down.</p>

<h2>Ch - 8: Pointers</h2>
<p><a name="pointers"></a></p>
<h4>Pointers</h4>
<p>Every variable is assigned a space in memory that it can use to store value.</p>
<p>An <code>int</code> variable takes 4 (2 in some machines) bytes, <code>char</code> takes a single byte and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to have an actual address in memory device where the space is reserved
for a specific variable.</p>
<p>This is one of the reason why some languages are called low level. They provide you with ability to 
get close to the machine and manipulate things.</p>
<p>You use ampersand (&amp;) to get the address of a variable. For example: if you have an integer variable
named <code>n</code>, <code>&amp;n</code> would give you the address of n i.e. its location in memory. </p>
<p>An address is a number. It is normally written in hexadecimal digits. But they are basically just integers.
So, a pointer is just a variable whose value is some integer that represents some location in memory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">pt</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">pt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In Above, we have an integer variable <code>num</code> and an integer pointer <code>pt</code>. In the last line <code>pt</code> is assigned a
value which is the address of <code>num</code> i.e. <code>&amp;n</code>. So now, <code>pt</code> holds the address of some memory location, and <code>num</code>
holds the data/value stored at that location. </p>
<p>Now, once you have the location, what could you do with it ? </p>
<p>For one thing, you could go to the address and see what is stored at that location. This is called <strong>dereferencing</strong>
as we are going from a reference(a pointer) to the thing it is referring(the value).</p>
<p>You can do that with an asterisk(*):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">pt</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="cm">/* prints 5 */</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, another thing you can do with the address is do arithmetic on the address itself. What does that mean?</p>
<p>Say you have an array <code>char a[10]</code>. We know that <code>a</code> actually stores the address of the first element of the
array - that is the location of <code>a[0]</code>.</p>
<p>We also know that an array has a chunk of memory allocated all at one place. So, for example if <code>&amp;a[0]</code>, the address of
the first element of <code>a</code>, were 2740004 then <code>&amp;a[10]</code> would be 2740013 and every other elements would lie in between.</p>
<p>So, we can do maths on the address itself and dereference it to loop through an array. Like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;C Programming Language.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">pt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="cm">/* equivalent to doing</span>
<span class="cm">    char *pt = &amp;text[0];</span>
<span class="cm">    */</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
        <span class="cm">/* deferencing an address</span>
<span class="cm">        to get the char value */</span>
        <span class="n">putchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pt</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">));</span>

<h4>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h4>
<p><em>Note: Recommend reading <a href="#self-referential-structure">this</a> first</em></p>
<p>Memory allocation is essentially the process of reserving memory for a variable. It's
mostly done in the compile time. Compiler looks at the code to figure out how many variables
there are and how much space do each one of them need. This is called <strong>static allocation</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the compiler doesn't know how much memory the program needs. For eg. we could keep
adding more and more node to a Linked list (or other self referential data type) when the program
is being run as per need.</p>
<p>So, we need to be able to allocate memory at the runtime. This is called <strong>dynamic memory allocation</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two important function to learn for dynamic memory allocation: <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free</code>. These
are part of the standard input/output library. So, <code>stdio.h</code> includes this.</p>
<p><a name="malloc"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>malloc()</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This function is used to ask for a space in memory. </p>
<p><code>malloc(int size)</code> allocates <code>size</code>(in bytes) amount of memory and returns the address from which that chunk of memory starts.</p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="cm">/* Declare a char pointer */</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">[];</span>
    <span class="cm">/* text is a pointer but</span>
<span class="cm">    doesn&#39;t have an address</span>
<span class="cm">    assigned to it yet */</span>

    <span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">malloc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="cm">/* malloc returns an address</span>
<span class="cm">    which is assigned to text */</span>

    <span class="cm">/* fill the array with an</span>
<span class="cm">    string &quot;hi&quot; */</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;h&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;i&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sc">&#39;\0&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a name="free"></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>free()</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you malloc a chunk of memory, it's reserved. You could run out of RAM if you keep malloc'ing memory.
You should always "free" a memory that was reserved using malloc if you are done using it.</p>
<p><code>free()</code> takes in the address of the first block of memory that was malloc'ed and frees it for use.</p>
<p>So, continuing above example, after you're done with the array <code>text</code>, you should free it as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%s&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="cm">/* if &#39;text&#39; is no longer needed</span>
<span class="cm">    in the program */</span>
    <span class="n">free</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At this stage, the memory that was allocated, whose address was stored in <code>text</code> is free. But the variable
<code>text</code> still remains. It still has the address as its value. But it can't be dereferenced any longer. Because <code>text</code>
no longer has the permission to access that block of memory. </p>
<p>But we can always use <code>malloc()</code> to reserve some memory and store the address into `text** if we so need.</p>
<p><em>Note: Also see <a href="structure-pointer">struct pointers</a></em></p>
<h4>Array of Pointers</h4>
<p>Array of pointers is just like a character array but with pointer variables instead of <code>char</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="cm">/* character array */</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="cm">/* array of int pointers */</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">];</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>ptrs</code> is an array of 10 int pointers.</p>

<h2>Ch - 9: Structures and Unions</h2>
<p><a name="structures"></a></p>
<h4>Structures</h4>
<p>Structures are essentially means to custom (compound) data types in C programming language.</p>
<p>Two keywords are relevant when it comes to structures - <code>struct</code> and <code>typedef</code>.</p>
<p>Struct is used to group together basic data types to make more complex data types as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">DOB</span><span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">day</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>

    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">DOB</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This defines a structure with name <code>struct DOB</code>. You can declare a variable that looks like struct
DOB as we defined. But it's tedious to have to use two words to refer to a data type. So, there is <code>typedef</code>
that allows you to define a new type and give it a name once and for all. For ex:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">DOB</span><span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">day</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">dob</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This defines a new data type <code>dob</code> for us and we can do <code>dob x;</code> to create a variable named x of 'dob' type just as we'd do
<code>int x;</code> for integers.</p>
<p>The <code>dob</code> type as defined above takes 12 bytes in memory because it is made of 3 integers and each integer takes 4 bytes.
Once declared values can be written in the variable as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">dob</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">dob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">day</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">dob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">month</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">dob</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1999</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p><a name="self-referential-structure"></a></p>
<h4>Self Referential Structure</h4>
<p>We saw above that custom data types use predefined primitive data types (for eg. int, floats, etc) to create something
more complex. </p>
<p>Self referential datatype is custom datatype that use itself as a building block. How does that work ! Let's see an example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">next</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>

    <span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="n">llist</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We defined a struct named <code>item</code>. It has an integer named data and a pointer to a <code>struct item</code>. </p>
<p>That is every instance of <code>struct item</code> has a reference (pointer) to another instance of <code>struct item</code> itself.</p>
<p>Hence the name self-referential.</p>
<p>What is the use of doing this? Well, these are just like arrays but unlike array, you don't have to
know how many items there are going to be in the array at the time of declaration. You can keep
adding at the end of the data as you go.</p>
<p>These are known as <strong>linked list</strong>. And each item is commonly known as a node.</p>
<p>So, a linked list is a chain of nodes onto which you can always attach more nodes.</p>
<p>To show it visually, it looks something like this:
<img alt="Linked list in graphics" src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/gq/2013/03/Linkedlist.png"></p>
<p><a name="union"></a></p>
<h4>Union</h4>
<p>Union is similar to struct - only difference is that only one of the member of a union can have a value stored
at a time. While all of the members of a struct eg. day, month, year in dob type above can and do
usually have values assigned to them, union on the other hand only has only one of its elements assigned with value.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">union</span> <span class="n">Data</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="p">};</span>

    <span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">union</span> <span class="n">Data</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Everything above is similar to struct, except for the keyword union.</p>
<p>This defines a type named <code>data</code> which is a <code>union</code> and can store either an integer, a float, or a
character array of length 5 - only one of them at any given time !</p>
<p>The size reserved in memory for <code>data</code> type is then 5 bytes because int and float both take 4 bytes
and char array above is specified to take 5 bytes. So, The largest of the members decides the memory
allocation size for the union.</p>
<p>Passing structure, union, or structure pointer and union pointer work similarly as the native data
types.</p>
<p><a name="Arrays within structure"></a></p>
<h4>Arrays within Structure</h4>
<p>Let's define a datatype to store simple data of a student.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">];</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">roll</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">student</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now lets create an instance and add values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">student</span> <span class="n">rohan</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">rohan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Rohan Sharma&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">rohan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">roll</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">rohan</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a name="structure-pointer"></a></p>
<h4>Structure Pointer</h4>
<p><em>Note: read <a href="#malloc">malloc()</a> first if you haven't already.</em></p>
<p>These are just like any other pointers. This is how you declare them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">dob</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">myBday</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>myBday</code> is now a pointer that points to a <code>struct dob</code> type of data.</p>
<p>Dereferencing struct pointer is a little different. Instead of period (.) to
access elements of a struct, you use arrow (-&gt;).</p>
<p>But before we do, first we need to create a space in memory for our variable
and assign the address of that memory to <code>myBday</code>. We use malloc:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">myBday</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">malloc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">sizeof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">dob</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>sizeof()</code> returns the size that the struct dob data requires in bytes which is
given as argument to <code>malloc()</code>. The addresss
returned is assigned to myBday.</p>
<p>Now, let's assign values to the struct itself.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">day</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">month</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">myBday</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1992</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And once you are done with myBday, it's good idea to free the memory using <code>free(myBday);</code></p>
<p>Union pointers are done similarly.</p>
